The Customer has his own vacation plan created in an xlsx-file. 
This file is being used to take some data about vacation quantity, dates, and durations.
Using these data, the script will create a new xlsx-file that has a detailed plan for each employee.
Also, each holiday (Serbian holidays calendar has been used here) is being taken into account before we use it there.
